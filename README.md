# Anime-Data-Analysis

This project dives into the Anime Dataset I created by scraping data from multipe websites. The goal is to investigate the dataset's various aspects, such as the distribution of anime ratings, popularity, user preferences, and genres. By employing Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, the aim is to visually represent and analyze the data, gaining insights into the anime community's preferences and trends.

# About - Dataset:

I have used Web scraping to get Anime data from multiple websites like anilist, boxoffice mojo, my anime list and anisearch. I got the real time data but its not a lot as i just want to learn more about webscraping

if you need more data you can refer to "Anime Recommendations Database" dataset on kaggle. It is a comprehensive dataset that provides information about a wide range of anime series. It includes details such as anime titles, genres, episodes, ratings, popularity, and member statistics from the MyAnimeList platform. The dataset also encompasses user-generated data, such as user ratings, reviews, and recommendations. With over 12,000 anime entries and rich metadata, this dataset is suitable for various analysis tasks, including recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and trend exploration within the anime community. It can be a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and anime enthusiasts alike.
